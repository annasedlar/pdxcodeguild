# Exercise: Create a Simple HTML Page

## Objective

Create a simple page in HTML to get familiar with how tags work.

1. Download the following file to your code folder: [structure-minimum.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/master/2.%20HTML%20%26%20CSS/solutions/structure-minimum.html?token=AAAQ0heDY9-AL4xGbXzBe52TtQ1iZOdoks5XYX_fwA%3D%3D)
1. Keep `structure.html` intact and make a **copy** of it to use for this exercise (weâ€™ll be doing this a lot, so use `structure.html` as your starting template); call it `simple-page.html`
1. Where you see `<!-- content goes here -->`, replace that with tags containing various content; try to use as many of the tags in the [HTML lesson](https://github.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/blob/master/2.%20HTML%20%26%20CSS/html.md) as you can (i.e. headers, paragraphs, lists, images, links, etc.)

## Extra Credit

Use the [HTML element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to find tags not covered in [the HTML lesson](https://github.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/blob/master/2.%20HTML%20%26%20CSS/html.md) (e.g., `<address></address>`, `<cite></cite>`, or `<dl></dl>`) and use them appropriately in your document.
