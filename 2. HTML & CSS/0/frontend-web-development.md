# Frontend Web Development

> The user interface _is_ the application.

The above is a quote from [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-user-interface-is-the-application/), one of the creators of our good friend, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

His point is that in many ways it doesn’t matter how elegant and efficient the code underlying a website or application is. If the UI is crappy or ill-conceived, users will not (want to) use it. To the user, the interface is what they see, what they interact with. To users, the interface _is_ the application.

For a website, the people who create the UI are [frontend developers](http://www.frontendhandbook.com).

_Note: Frontend, front-end, front end…all of these are accepted spellings according to the people who write dictionaries for a living._

## Our Languages

As frontend developers, we build user experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Think of the coolest, most mind-blowing websites you’ve seen. There are great frontend developers behind every one.

### HTML

HyperText Markup Language is the basis for all web pages. This tag-based language provides structure and meaning to content delivered over the web. HTML is where most of the accessibility hooks on a web page reside.

### CSS

Cascading Style Sheets is used to implement style and design. Its capabilities are vast, but its semantics can be confusing. We will focus on the major concepts, then get familiar with some tools to make building great websites dead simple.

### JavaScript

JavaScript (_not_ [Javascript](http://javascriptnotjavascript.com/)) is the _lingua franca_ of the web. It’s possible to build complex web applications entirely using JavaScript, from the backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) to the frontend (React, Angular, Ember). For purposes of this course, we will be using JavaScript to [enhance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) our web pages with behaviors that improve the user experience.

## Our Tools

We work in the browser. Lucky for us, these days great tools are built in to most modern browsers for viewing the source code behind web pages, debugging CSS and JavaScript, measuring performance, and otherwise understanding what’s happening on the pages you build.

Right click on this page. Choose “Inspect”. This is the web inspector. [Get to know it.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) It’s your new best friend.

## Our Responsibility

Users have higher expectations than ever of how websites will behave. Think of the good and bad experiences you’ve had on the web.

For example, have you ever tried to buy something on a website and come away with the impression that the company didn’t actually _want_ your money?

Imagine trying to complete that same flow if you were couldn’t see or had limited use of your hands or were red/green color blind.

As frontend developers, we have the power to create great user experiences. I believe we have a responsibility to do so as well.
