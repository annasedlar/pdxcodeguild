# CodePen

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/) is a kind of playground for frontend developers. It allows you to create and save fragments of HTML, style them with CSS, and add behaviors with JavaScript.

Many developers use CodePen to experiment and to show off cool ideas. The following are just a few examples of interesting pens:

- [Menu Button to Hamburger](http://codepen.io/kaylolo/pen/KzLwmR)
- [Magic scrolling colour](http://codepen.io/daveredfern/pen/zBGBJV)
- [Layered Pyramid](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/wMvPaQ)
- [Pure CSS Rotating Spiral Image Gallery](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/DhnGF)

_Hint: Interesting pens you come across would make great posts in the [#reading-list](https://portlandcodeguild.slack.com/messages/reading-list/) Slack channel!_

Weâ€™ll be using CodePen a lot. Go create an account now.
