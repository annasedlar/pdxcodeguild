# Exercise: Research a CSS Topic & Share with the Class

## Objective

Research one of the topics below and share what you learn with your fellow students. **Go team!**

![T.E.A.M.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/elgnR2mPMxo/hqdefault.jpg)

1. Choose from one of the following topics:
    - CSS selectors
    - The Box Model
    - Flexbox
    - Typography
    - Colors
    - The `position` property
    - The `z-index` property
    - CSS transitions, transforms, & animations
1. Spend the next **hour** learning _everything_ (seriously, cram like your grade depends on it) you can about it, including, but not necessarily limited to the following:
    - Syntax
    - Uses
    - Gotchas
    - Examples
1. Present your findings to the class (demos/examples + code)

_If you need help getting Google to show you good information on your topic, let Jasmine or me know ASAP. You only have an hour, so don’t waste precious time!_
