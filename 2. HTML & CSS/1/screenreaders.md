# Screen Readers

A [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) is software that presents user interfaces via an audio interface. One common use of screen readers is to help vision-impaired users consume and navigate web pages.

## Software

Both OS X and Windows 10 have screen readers built-in. The following are guides for using each:

## Mini-exercise

Spend the next 10 or 15 minutes navigating around some web pages using your systemâ€™s built-in screen reader software. First, use it with your eyes open, then try using it with your eyes closed!
