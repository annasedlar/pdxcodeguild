# Node.js & NPM

## What is Node.js?

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a super fast JavaScript interpreter. It allows you to run JavaScript outside of a browser, for example as a web server or to run build scripts.

## What is NPM?

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) stands for “Node Package Manager”. It’s a super popular way to share code, especially JavaScript code, because it makes it dead simple to manage dependencies among complex JavaScript modules.

_Installing on Windows shouldn’t be much different from installing on OS X, but if you run into trouble, follow along with [this blog post](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)._
