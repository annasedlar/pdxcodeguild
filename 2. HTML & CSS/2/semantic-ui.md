# Semantic UI

There are several, good CSS frameworks available that can help you build UI more efficiently, including [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/).

In class, we’re going to use [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) because I’ve found it particularly easy for beginners to use.

------

## What does it do?

Semantic UI gives you a solid, professional-looking base to work from when building complex web sites and web applications.

Among other things, Semantic UI offers styles for the following categories of use cases:

- Typograhy & color
- Layout (e.g., grids)
- Forms
- Breadcrumbs
- Menus
- Tables
- _& cetera, ad infinitum_ (almost)

------

## How do you use it?

The simplest way to inegrate Semantic UI into your pages is just to download [this file](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-CSS/archive/master.zip) and link to the files `semantic.min.css` &amp; `semantic.min.js` from the `<head></head>` of your document.

Semantic UI (like many frameworks) also provides the source code for the framework in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (SCSS) format so you can build it yourself, extending it to fit your needs. That’s a bit beyond the scope of what we will be doing in class, but let me know if you want help getting that working.
