# Exercise: Complete “Learn Sass” Tutorial

## Objective

Become familiar with the capabilities of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

_Note: This is a pair programming exercise, but each member of the pair should host their own solutions in their repos._

1. Create a new directory in your code directory called `learn-sass`
2. From the Terminal, run `npm install -g learn-sass`
3. From the Terminal, run `learn-sass`
4. For each topic, create a new `.scss` file using the name of the topic (e.g., for the variables topic, create a file called `variables.scss`)
5. Complete each topic in the file with the corresponding name

Official solutions are located in [the learn-sass GitHub repo](https://github.com/claudiopro/learn-sass). I also have [my working solutions]() in my repo on GitHub.
