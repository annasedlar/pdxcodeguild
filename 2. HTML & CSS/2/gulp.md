# Gulp

Gulp is a system that allows you to automate repetitive tasks. We are going to use it to compile our [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files automagically whenever we make changes to them.

To do that, we’re going to need the following packages:

- [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp)
- [gulp-watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-watch)
- [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass)

------

## Install Packages

To keep things simple, we’re going to install the above packages globally so they’re available across all of our projects.

From a terminal window, run the following commands:

    npm install -g gulp
    npm install -g gulp-watch
    npm install -g gulp-sass

Let me know if you have trouble with this. We’re going to depend heavily on these tools!
