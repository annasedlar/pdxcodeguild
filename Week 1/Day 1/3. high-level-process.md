My goal is to structure the class as much like a developer job as possible. To that end, below is a high-level overview of how a typical week will flow.

- Monday
	- Morning:
		- Assign pair programming partner for the week
		- Discuss learning objectives for the week (technical & interpersonal)
		- Go over assignments for the week
		- Instruction on that week’s interpersonal skill
	- Afternoon:
		- Instruction on technical concepts
- Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
	- Mornings:
		- Instruction on technical concepts
	- Afternoons:
		- Work on assignments in pairs
- Friday
	- Morning:
		- Retrospective/demos
	- Afternoon:
		- 20-30 minute 1-on-1
		- Work on assignments in pairs

Additionally, when possible, I’ll bring in external speakers to talk about topics of interest. These will be no more than 1 hour, once per week.
