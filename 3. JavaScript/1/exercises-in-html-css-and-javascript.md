# Exercises in HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

This ought to keep you busy for a while…. 😉

- **Copy** this Trello card under your name and check off the exercises as you complete them.
- All of the exercises can be completed as pens on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) (you can fork [the template pen](http://codepen.io/segdeha/pen/LZNvMV) and use it as your starting point for most of them)

Everyone should do the “easy” exercises. Intermediate and advanced exercises will be considered extra credit.

## Easy

- `JavaScript` — Implement a pen where, as the user types in a number into a text input, the number is shown below the input formatted with commas (in US English style)
- `JavaScript` — Implement a pen where the user can input a Roman numeral and the output is the number in Arabic numerals
- `CSS` — Implement a pen where an element on the page wobbles as closely as possible to the way an app icon wobbles on iOS when it’s ready to be deleted

## Intermediate

- `JavaScript`, `CSS` — Implement a pen where, when the `<h1></h1>` is clicked, it animates to the right by `100px` over the course of `1s` (and back when clicked again)

## Advanced

- `JavaScript`, `CSS` — Implement a pen where as the user moves the mouse around the page, circular part of an image is revealed underneath the mouse (hint: use a [CSS gradient mask](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/) to reveal the image underneath)
- `JavaScript` — Implement a pen that animates an element on the page using `window.requestAnimationFrame` rather than CSS animations
