# Exercise: Change the Background Color

## Objective

Get familiar with basic DOM operations by creating a program that changes the background color of an element to whatever the user enters.

1. Fork [this pen](http://codepen.io/segdeha/pen/LZNvMV) & name it “Change the Background”
1. Select the `<div></div>` element with the id `result`
1. Set the background color of the element _using JavaScript_ to the color input by the user

## Extra Credit

1. Validate that the user input is a valid color value of any of the following types: [color name](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/), [hex triplet, RGB, RGBA, HSL, or HSLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#CSS_colors)
1. Even better than validating the user’s input, only give them ways of entering/selecting colors that you know will be valid; this could mean giving them a `<select></select>` list of color names, 4 inputs (e.g., for R, G, B, & A), or finding a color picker widget to integrate into the page
