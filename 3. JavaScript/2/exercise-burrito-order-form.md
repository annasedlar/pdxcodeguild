# Exercise: Burrito Order Form

## Objective

Practice working as a team using modular JavaScript.

## Requirements

![El Burrito Grande Order Form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/master/3.%20JavaScript/assets/burrito-order-form.png?token=AAAQ0lClKONXHz9NWzUps-E0nK6mQnRnks5XlpukwA%3D%3D)

Our burrito order form needs the following features:

- Form validation when the user submits the form
- When the user changes ingredients, this should be reflected in the ingredients list
- When the user changes ingredients or delivery options, the total price should update

------

## Directions

1. If you havenâ€™t already, `git clone https://github.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild.git`
1. Open `pdxcodeguild/3. JavaScript/solutions/modular_javascript/index.html` in a browser
1. As a team, review the requirements, which are documented in [JavaScript doc blocks](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/coding-standards/docblock-standard-javascript.html) in the following three files:
    - `js/ingredients-updater.js`
    - `js/total-updater.js`
    - `js/validator.js`
1. Decide amongst yourselves who will be responsible for which module
1. Create a branch for your part of the work (e.g., `ingredients-updater`)
1. When your module is ready, [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) and I will merge it into master

Each of the modules should be able to work independently, but you should work together, pair, whiteboard, whatever it takes to satisfy the requirements.

As per usual, I will act as product owner and senior dev for any questions the team might have.
