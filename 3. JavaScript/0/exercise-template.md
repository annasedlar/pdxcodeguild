# Exercise Template

I created [a pen](http://codepen.io/segdeha/pen/dXMjYe) you can use to complete simple JavaScript assignments. It has a single form field with a “Go” button. It’s set up so you can easily consume the user’s input and show a result on the page.

The process you should use is the following:

1. Fork [the pen](http://codepen.io/segdeha/pen/dXMjYe)
1. Rename your forked copy of the pen
1. Edit the content in the HTML (but **not** the tags!) to fit the assignment
1. Edit the JavaScript until you get the desired result
