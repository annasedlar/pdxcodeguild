# Anatomy of a Web Page

Web pages consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re like birthday cakes.

HTML is the cake. It’s covered with CSS frosting that makes it look pretty. Then you add some JavaScript to the top to give it a little sparkle.

It’s totally possible to build a beautiful, tasty web page with only HTML and CSS.
