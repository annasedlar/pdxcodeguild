# Exercise: Is it a Social Security Number?

## Objective

Get familiar with regular expressions in JavaScript by determining whether a given input is a Social Security Number.

1. Create a new file called `ssn.html` based on [this template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/master/2.%20HTML%20%26%20CSS/solutions/structure-with-inline-css-and-javascript.html?token=AAAQ0sNxHlhyXhaAZLGeWybrKtZIAd68ks5XZzmgwA%3D%3D)
1. Add your JavaScript inside the `<script></script>` tag
1. To run your program, you will need to load `ssn.html` in a web browser
1. Using JavaScript, prompt the user for a Social Security Number (SSN)
1. Validate whether or not their input is a valid SSN using [regular expressions](https://github.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/blob/master/3.%20JavaScript/0/regular-expressions.md)
1. Pop up an alert telling the user whether or not their input is a valid SSN

_Note: A valid SSN consists of 9 digits with optional dashes between digits 3 & 4 and digits 5 & 6. E.g., '123-45-6789' or '123456789'._
