# The Capstone

The capstone project is the most exciting part of the course! It’s also the most challenging!

It’s where you finally get to use all of the technologies we’ve been studying together to create something of your choosing. It will be the anchor of your portfolio when you start looking for internships and jobs.

**In other words, the capstone is the most important part of the course!**

## Concept

Start thinking **today** about ideas for your capstone project. You’ll want to take on something complex enough to demonstrate understanding of all of the course material, but small enough in scope that you can accomplish it in 3 to 4 weeks’ time.

One of the hardest parts of most capstone projects (and all software projects, to be honest!) is containing scope. For the capstone, you should be tackling only the [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP). You can always add more functionality to the application later.

I suggest starting a list in a notepad or text document, not of _ideas_ necessarily, but of _problems_ you encounter that you think could be solved through a web application.

_This is harder to do than it sounds, as evidenced by [this thread on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-everyday-problems-do-people-wish-an-app-could-solve) where someone asked about problems that could be solved by apps and almost everyone responded with app ideas._

For example, I share a car with my girlfriend and we park it on the street. When one of us parked it and the other went to use it, we wouldn’t always know where it was last parked. The **problem** was that we didn’t have a good way to communicate where we’d parked the car. The **solution** was that I built a simple mobile web app we could both use to mark where the car was last parked.

You can [look around the internet for ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/292zi4/what_do_you_wish_there_was_an_app_for/) or you can draw from your own experience. In any case, start _today_ making a list of problems you think could possibly be solved using a web application.

## Requirements

Your capstone **must** make use of all of the major topics we covered in the course.

- Python
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- Django
- Databases
- Documentation (relevant comments, docstrings, readme)
- Testing
- Proper language style

I will reject project proposals that are not sufficienctly complex to allow you to demonstrate proficiency in all of these areas.

You are encouraged to dive deep in areas that interest you. Commitment and striving for mastery in a topic area is appreciated by prospective employers.

## Schedule

The formal schedule for working on your capstone is:

- **6/29 –** Capstone proposal due at end of day (EOD)
- **6/29 thru 7/6 –** Revise capstone based on instructor feedback
- **7/6 –** Approved proposal
- **7/15 & 7/22 –** Capstone work
- **7/25 –** Class becomes just capstone work
- **8/12 (Last day of class) –** Capstone demos & feedback
- **8/12 EOD –** Capstone MVP due
- **After 8/12 –** After class ends, you should continue to work on your capstone in anticipation of a demo day PDX Code Guild will set up for the public (including potential employers!)
- **3-4 weeks after last class:** Demo Day for Recruiters

From this point forward, if you finish exercises/assignments early, please work on your capstone; brainstorm ideas, plan out implementations, etc.

We will be set aside the entire day that proposals are due to work on them. _Start working on them before then!_ Anticipate it taking at least 6 hours to thoroughly investigate and document your proposal idea.

### Micro-exercise: Create your capstone repo

1. Create a new repo on GitHub called `capstone`
1. Create 2 documents at the root of the repo: `README.md` and `PROPOSAL.md`

`README.md` will be used to document how someone (me!) can get your site/app up and running. It should include the following:

- The name of the site or application
- One or two sentences that describe its purpose
- Setup steps/technical requirements
- Basic guide to how to use the app

`PROPOSAL.md`, as the name implies, will be where you document your actual capstone proposal.

As you work on your capstone, push everything you create to this GitHub repo. It’s an easy way to back up your work and it’s how you’ll be turning in your proposal.

On or around 7/25, the tone of the class will shift from being a classroom setting, to more of a co-working space with me, Jasmine, and your fellow students as resources.
