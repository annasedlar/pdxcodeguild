# Interpersonal Skill: Networking

The word “networking” may conjure up for you some unfavorable images.

The simple fact is that, because most open jobs are never published, between 40% and 80% of jobs are landed through networking, so—like it or not—you’d better learn how to play the game.

Or better yet, learn how to make it _not a game,_ but a process of creating real connections with other people with the purpose of finding ways to mutually help each other.

## LinkedIn

[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) is not the end-all-be-all of networking, but it is the baseline. If you don’t already have a profile, [sign up now](https://linkedin.com). If you do have a profile, make sure it’s professional and up-to-date. Recruiters start on LinkedIn. So do many hiring managers.

## Effective Networking

> Some jobseekers misunderstand the purpose of networking. They think it’s all about them. They constantly ask without giving, which is the quickest way to drive away potential allies. People who have the true networking mindset realize that they should first help others, before thinking of themselves.

1. **Show up —** Put yourself in groups of people doing the thing you want to be doing (even if you don’t do it yourself!)
1. **Put in the work —** Treat networking like a job; set aside X number of hours per week and put in the work
1. **Be fearless —** Like many developers, I’m an introvert, but I don’t let that stop me from meeting and connecting with people at meetups
1. **Set small goals —** If you find the whole thing intimidating, set a goal of meeting and talking to 1 person
1. **Be shockingly helpful —** Go out of your way to do things for people with no thought of the reward
1. **Stick with it —** Just like anything (weight lifting, learning to be a developer…), networking consistently will reap benefits over time
