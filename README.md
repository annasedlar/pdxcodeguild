## Description

Python-Based Junior Developer is an intense twelve-week, part time, hands-on immersive course that combines individual projects and group study to give students the skills and habits they need to succeed as a junior developer.

## Overview

Students will learn Python, Django, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, how to think like a programmer, and important developer practices including source control, testing, and debugging. Students practice skills using pair programming and group work, as well as work on personal portfolio projects.

## Basis for Final Grade

Grading is on a Pass With Distinction/Pass/Fail scale. Students are graded on each individual section based on specific in-class exercises and/or projects and tech challenges given at the end of each unit.
**In-class exercises:** Students edit and debug each exercise or project until it passes. All exercises and projects submitted for grading must pass for the student to pass the course. To receive a grade of Pass with Distinction, student must do more than the minimum required on exercises, successfully using additional skills outside the lesson, for exercises and work on their project.**Pair Programming:** A portion of your grade in this section will be based on your interpersonal skills while pair-programming. You must pass pair-programming to pass the class.**Tech challenges:** At the end of each unit, students will be given one or more problem to work on independently and one interactive challenge/code review. Tech challenges will be graded on a curve. Students must pass tech challenges in four of the five sections to pass the course.
To achieve grade of Pass With Distinction for the course, student must:- Pass pair programming,- Pass each exercise, with an overall grade of pass with distinction in four of the five sections- Pass each tech challenge, and interactive challenge/code review, receiving a grade of pass with distinction on at least three of them## Course Expectations### Timely workStudents work on projects in class with the support of the instructor, other students, documentation and online resources. Students work on projects until they pass. Students are expected to keep up with the rest of the class. Students unable to keep up with the class will be asked to have a meeting with the instructor and director to develop a plan to get student caught up. If student fails to get back on track within two weeks, student may be asked to take a leave of absence until the student’s situation is changed sufficiently to allow student to keep up with the class.### AttendancePDX Code Guild maintains attendance records for each student. Students are expected to be on time and attend all scheduled class times. The school requires ninety percent (90%) completion of class hours in order to receive a certificate of completion from the course. If in any 14-day period your attendance is less than 90%, you will be notified and placed on probation for a period of 14 days. If you meet the attendance requirement in the subsequent 14 days, you will be removed from probation. If you fail to correct your attendance problem, you will be dismissed from the school.
If dismissed from the school, you will be eligible for re-admittance without filling out a new application after a minimum period of 60 days. You may be required to provide proof that the problem that caused your chronic absenteeism has been resolved.### ConductStudents are expected to comply with the PDX Code Guild Code of Conduct. Students are given a copy of the PDX Code Guild code of conduct and a copy of the school catalog containing the Code of Conduct and Policy on Code of Conduct Infringement upon registration. Please refer to your copy of the code of conduct and Policy on Code of Conduct Infringement sections of the school catalog for more information.### Plagiarism
All work submitted must be the student’s own work. It is acceptable and expected that students will use online and print resources and work with classmates to complete assignments. It’s normal in programming to use bits of code that someone else has written. Be careful when doing this; you must make sure that you understand what each line of code does. Give credit when you work with others or use parts of existing code.

For example:

    # based on: http://stackoverflow.com/a/931095/11577
    reversedStr = 'Eva, can I see bees in a cave?'[::-1]

It is unacceptable to copy someone else’s work in its entirety and submit it as your own work.### Course schedule
The course is broken into 5 major themes:

1. Python
1. HTML/CSS
1. JavaScript
1. Django/SQL
1. Capstone Project

------

The following is the rough schedule we will follow. I say ‘rough’ because we can adjust to some degree if, for example, it takes more/less time to cover certain topics or the class is interested in spending more time on a particular subject.

**Weeks 1, 2, 3:** Python

**Week 4:** HTML/CSS

**Weeks 5, 6, 7:** JavaScript

**Week 5:** Start capstone proposal

**Week 6:** Capstone proposal due

**Weeks 8, 9, 10:** Django

**Weeks 10, 11, 12:** Capstone project

**Week 12:** Capstone project due by end of the last day of class

**Post Class Weeks 1, 2:** Capstone revisions/additions/polish

**Post Class Week 3:** Capstone Demo Day

------
My goal is to structure the class as much like a developer job as possible. To that end, below is a high-level overview of how a typical week will flow.

- Monday
	- Morning:
		- Assign pair programming partner for the week
		- Discuss learning objectives for the week (technical & interpersonal)
		- Go over assignments for the week (i.e. sprint planning)
		- Instruction on that week’s interpersonal skill
	- Afternoon:
		- Instruction on technical concepts
- Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
	- Mornings:
		- Instruction on technical concepts
	- Afternoons:
		- Work on assignments in pairs
- Friday
	- Morning:
		- Retrospective/demos
	- Afternoon:
		- 20-30 minute 1-on-1
		- Work on assignments in pairs

Additionally, when possible, I’ll bring in external speakers to talk about topics of interest. These will be no more than 1 hour, once per week.

Much like you will when working as a web developer, you will be expected to gather & clarify requirements for assignments. I will act as the ‘product owner’ and you will need to communicate status to me throughout the week. Our TA and I will also act as ‘senior developers’ in the sense that you will be able to ask us for help in working through technical aspects of the assignments.## Materials and software used in this courseStudents are required to bring and use their own laptop for the course. Any operating system is fine, but the machine should be new enough to run several applications at once without slowing down considerably.### SoftwareIf you don’t already, make sure you have all of the following installed on your system:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)

#### Python 3

For the sake of convenience, you may wish to set up your system so that typing the command `python` at the command line launches Python 3, rather than your system default (usually Python 2.7). Here are [directions for how to do that on OS X](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18425592).

Here is how I have my `~/.bash_aliases` file set up:

    alias python='python3'
    alias python2='\python'

By using the above, I can type `python` to default to Python 3, but still launch Python 2 by typing `python2`. 99% of the time in class we will be using Python 3.

#### Atom

Open Atom and install the following packages:

- python-tools
- python-indent
- python-debugger
- autocomplete-python
- language-python
- python-autopep8
- linter-python-pep8
