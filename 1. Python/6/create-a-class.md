# Exercise: Create a Class

## Objective

Create a `Car` class with some attributes typical of automobiles, then use it to create some instances of different cars.

1. Create a new directory called `cars`
1. Create the following 2 files inside the `cars` directory: `main.py` and `car.py`
1. In `car.py`, create a class called `Car` with the following characteristics:
    - A shared property called `number_of_wheels` set to the value `4`
    - The following instance properties that get set upon initialization:
        - `color`
        - `number_of_doors`
    - A `honk` method that, when called, prints out the word `honk`
1. In `main.py`, import your `Car` class and create 2 or 3 instances of cars with different characteristics; when you run `main.py` it should print out the characteristics of your `Car` instances
