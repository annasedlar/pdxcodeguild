# Exercise: Practice Inheritance

## Objective

Create new classes that inherit behaviors and attributes from existing classes.

1. Save this file to your local code folder: [inerhitance.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/master/1.%20Python/solutions/inheritance.py?token=AAAQ0jo1YweAzCzrDiNj_DCZbzGzvwDfks5XULGVwA%3D%3D)
1. Create a new class for a different kind of animal (e.g., `Cat` or `Bird`) with at least 1 attribute and 1 behavior specific to that type of animal
1. Create a new class using your new kind of animal to make it into a pet (e.g., `PetCat` or `PetBird`) that inherits from both the animal and the `Pet` class
1. Add tests to the `__test__` dictionary to verify that all is working as expected
