# Retrospective

In agile software methodologies, a retrospective is a meeting to discuss what was successful about the project or time period covered by the retrospective, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the improvements into future work cycles.

------

Typical of most retrospective processes, in ours we will cover the following:

1. Things we should continue doing
1. Things we should stop doing
1. Things we should start doing

------

Topics of discussion are often around process (i.e. should we continue to do daily standups?), but can include technical topics as well (should we ditch PyCharm for Xyz IDE?).
