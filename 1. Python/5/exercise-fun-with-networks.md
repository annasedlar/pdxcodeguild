# Fun with Networks

## Objective

Write a simple program that accesses a public JSON API and prints the results formatted in a readable way.

1. Create a new file called `random_users.py`
1. Fetch JSON representing 5 randomly generated people from the following URL: [http://api.randomuser.me/?results=5](http://api.randomuser.me/?results=5)
1. Print the results something like the following:

```
Name: Mr Aventino Lima
Email: aventino.lima@example.com
Username: heavybutterfly582
Registration date: 10/2/2002
Birth date: 6/5/1994

Name: Mrs Sheryl Gardner
Email: sheryl.gardner@example.com
Username: whiteduck688
Registration date: 8/11/2014
Birth date: 6/4/1983

# Repeat for the remaining people
```

_Hint: It might help you understand the structure of the returned JSON to run it through this [pretty printer](http://jsonprettyprint.com/)._
