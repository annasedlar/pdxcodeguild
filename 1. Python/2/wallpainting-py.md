# wallpainting.py

## Objective

All our friends are re-painting one wall of their rooms. They want us to figure out how much it’s going to cost.

1. Open Atom
1. Create a new file and save it as `wallpainting.py`
1. Implement a program that does the following:

Ask the user for:

1. Width of the wall.
1. Height of the wall.
1. How much a gallon of paint costs.

Assume one gallon of paint covers 400 square feet.

* Figure out and print how much it will cost to paint the wall with one coat
* Also ask the user for how many coats they’re going to put on, and calculate that cost

## Advanced

* Allow the user to enter multiple wall dimensions and add the total areas together before calculating the cost
