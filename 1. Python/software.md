# Software

If you don’t already, make sure you have all of the following installed on your system:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) and/or [PyCharm](https://account.jetbrains.com/a/aoszpv)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)

### Python 3

For the sake of convenience, you may wish to set up your system so that typing the command `python` at the command line launches Python 3, rather than your system default (usually Python 2.7). Here are [directions for how to do that on OS X](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18425592).

Here is how I have my `~/.bash_aliases` file set up:

    alias python='python3'
    alias python2='\python'

By using the above, I can type `python` to default to Python 3, but still launch Python 2 by typing `python2`. 99% of the time in class we will be using Python 3.
