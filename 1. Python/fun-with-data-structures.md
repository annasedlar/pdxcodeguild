# Fun With Data Structures

## Objective

Program should prompt the user with something generic like the following:

    Enter the name of either a conference or team:

If the user enters the name of a conference (either ‘AFC’ or ‘NFC’), prompt them for a division (‘East’, ‘North’, ‘South’, or ‘West’) and print out the names of the corresponding teams.

If the user enters the name of a team, print out the corresponding conference and division (e.g., if the user enters `Seattle Seahawks`, print `NFC West`).

If the user enters input that doesn’t make sense, prompt them again.
