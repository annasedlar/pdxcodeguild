# Daily Standup

Monday through Thursday of each week going forward, we will hold a “daily standup,” a short status meeting to keep the team aligned on tasks and impediments.

> We stand up to keep the meeting short.

The goal of our standups will be the following:

1. Create a shared understanding of the current set of goals
1. Coordinate efforts
1. Share problems and insights

The industry-standard format for standups has each person in the group take their turn answering the following questions:

1. What did I do **yesterday?**
1. What will I do **today?**
1. What **impediments** (if any) are in my way?

Anything that comes up that is outside the scope of those three questions is “parked” for later discussion.

It’s important to treat this like a ritual. I suggest we do standup at 11:45am each day so we have incentive to keep it under 15 minutes and get to lunch!
