## Objective

Write a simple program that [reads in a file](https://github.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/blob/master/1.%20Python/4/file-io.md) containing [JSON](https://github.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/blob/master/1.%20Python/4/json.md) and prints out some of the data.

1. Create a new directory called `json-reader`
1. In your new directory, create a new file called `main.py`
1. Save [data.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/master/1.%20Python/solutions/file-reader/data.json?token=AAAQ0qaCplLB_p7q4EhOcDBdsNIfkS9tks5XS4ADwA%3D%3D) to the same directory

The output to the screen when the program is run should be the following:
