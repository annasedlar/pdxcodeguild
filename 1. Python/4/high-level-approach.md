# Thinking Like a Programmer: High-Level Approach

![Calvin & Hobbes is the best.](https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-168646c0fd176ddedb4c606914ded909)

The following are some tips for approaching a complex programming problem:

- Remember to think in terms of the following:
    1. Setup
    1. Input
    1. Transform
    1. Output
- This might seem obvious, but make sure you understand the problem. Write it out on a sheet of paper or a whiteboard. Make diagrams. _Solve the problem first, write the code second!_
- Stub out functions to test whether you’re taking the right, high-level approach. Imagine you had all of the functions you needed to complete the program. What would they take as input? What would they return as output? Write the method signatures and docstrings and come back later to write the function bodies.
- Once you have your stubbed functions, write tests that describe their inputs and outputs. Start with one of the simpler functions. Add/revise your code until its tests pass. Move on to the next function.
- As much as possible, write functions that have a single responsibility.
